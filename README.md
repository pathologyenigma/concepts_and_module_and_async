## Motive

*cpp20 has been implemented by most of the mainstream cpp compiler like g++, msvc, clang, and I thought it's time for me to try cpp20 new features, and writes some code to test my learning*
(ps: this is more like a demos compilation than a real project)
## SetUp
*just install the lastest version of visual studio 2022(or I gonna say msvc version 14.31+)*
(ps: this project is about new features, so I not gives cross-platform support,  if you want, you can try cmake&clang or build2&gcc, I tried them before by using msvc and I failed)
